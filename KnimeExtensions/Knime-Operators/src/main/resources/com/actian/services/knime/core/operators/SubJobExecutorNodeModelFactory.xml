    <shortDescription>Executes a Dataflow graph.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            <p>Executes a dataflow graph.</p>
            <p>The graph is executed per row of data entering the node. The first
               field contains the file location of the datarush .dr file to execute.</p>

            <p>Additional fields are passed into the 'Start Node' of the workflow if
               such a node has been defined. Any outputs from a 'Stop Node' within the
               workflow will be copied into the output schema.</p>

            <p>If the node is executing within a Dataflow execution engine, then the same
               config will be applied to the child execution, otherwise the default
               engine configuration will be used.</p>

        <option name="Output Schema">
            <p>
            Define the output schema for the workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
            Tip. If the workflow to be executed has already been written, attach
            a 'Delimited Text Writer' node, and use 'Edit Schema/Save Schema...' to save
            the schema definition to a file, and reload it via this nodes configuration
            dialog.</p>
