    <name>Derive Group</name>
    <shortDescription>A more advanced user version of the Group node.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            <p>The Derive Group node aggregates data within key groups. It differs primarily from the 'Group' node
            in that you can specify more complex aggregations than provided by that nodes configuration dialog, and
            allows the use of any custom written aggregation functions.</p>
            <p>
            The node uses groups of consecutive equal keys ("key groups") to determine which data
            values to aggregate. The input data not be sorted; if it is already sorted, performance
            will be optimal.</p>
            <p>
            The output of the Derive Group node will include the key fields (if specified) and the outcome
            of each aggregation function. A row of output is generated for each distinct set of key values.
            If no key fields are specified, a single row will be output with the aggregation results for all
            input rows.</p>
